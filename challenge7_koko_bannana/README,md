# Challenge 7 – Koko’s Banana Buffet

## Problem Overview
Koko the monkey wants to eat all banana piles before the guards return in `k` hours.<br>
She must choose a constant eating speed `s` (bananas per hour).<br>
Determine the **minimum speed `s`** that allows her to finish all piles on time.<br>

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `piles` and integer `k`:<br>
- `piles[i]` = number of bananas in pile i<br>
- `k` = total hours available<br>
- Eating rule: each hour, Koko eats `s` bananas from a pile; if pile has fewer than `s`, finish it and move to next hour<br>
Return the **minimum integer speed `s`** such that Koko finishes all piles within `k` hours.<br>

## Function Requirement
Write a function that:<br>
- Takes an integer array `piles` and integer `k`<br>
- Returns an integer representing minimum speed<br>

**Function Name:** `calculate_minimum_speed(piles, k)`<br>

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ piles.size ≤ 10^4`<br>
- `1 ≤ piles[i] ≤ 10^9`<br>
- `piles.size ≤ k ≤ 10^9`<br>
- Solution should handle large piles efficiently using Binary Search<br>

## Examples

**Example 1**<br>
`piles = [5, 10, 3], k = 4`<br>
Minimum speed = 5 bananas/hr<br>

**Example 2**<br>
`piles = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 7`<br>
Minimum speed = 10 bananas/hr<br>

## Approaches

### 1. Brute Force Approach

**Idea**<br>
- Try all speeds from 1 to max pile size<br>
- Calculate total hours for each speed<br>
- Return first speed satisfying hours ≤ k<br>

**Time Complexity**<br>
O(maxPile × n) — too slow for large piles<br>

**Space Complexity**<br>
O(1)<br>

**Drawback**<br>
Inefficient for large piles (10^9 bananas)

### 2. Optimized Approach (Binary Search)

**Idea**<br>
- Binary search on possible speed range [1, maxPile]<br>
- For each candidate speed, compute total hours<br>
- Narrow search to find minimum feasible speed<br>

**Time Complexity**<br>
O(n × log(maxPile)) — efficient<br>

**Space Complexity**<br>
O(1)<br>

## Conclusion
Binary Search efficiently finds the minimum eating speed for Koko even when banana piles are very large.<br>
Brute force is conceptually simple but impractical for real constraints.<br>
