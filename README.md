# Logic-Forge-PSET2 <br>
**Solutions for Logic Forge PSET 2.**<br>
Includes brute-force and optimized implementations<br><br>

## Overview <br>
This PSET consists of 7 programming challenges.<br>
Each challenge has a dedicated file for its solution.<br>
The challenges focus on logic building, algorithm design, and problem-solving skills.<br><br>

## Challenges <br>
**The Mountain Peak Challenge**<br>
Logic to identify peaks or optimal summit points within sequences.<br><br>

**The Balanced Scales Challenge**<br>
Compute ways to balance weights or values under specific constraints.<br><br>

**The Mirror Quest: Finding the Longest Reflection**<br>
Find longest symmetric (mirror) subsequences or patterns in data.<br><br>

**The Royal Treasury**<br>
Design logic for optimal allocation, storage, or retrieval in treasure-like systems.<br><br>

**The Master Scheduler's Dilemma**<br>
Scheduling logic to maximize efficiency under timing constraints.<br><br>

**The High-Stakes Freelancer**<br>
Optimize freelancer decisions to maximize profit or success rate.<br><br>

**Koko’s Banana Buffet**<br>
Problem focused on optimal resource consumption or allocation over time.<br><br>

## Commit Strategy <br>
**Initial Commits:**<br>
- Brute-force solutions first<br>
- Basic correctness without heavy optimization<br><br>

**Optimized Commits:**<br>
- After initial pass, improve algorithms for efficiency<br>
- Add comments with time/space complexity<br><br>

## Language <br>
All solutions are implemented in **C++** with clear function decomposition and input/output handling.<br>
